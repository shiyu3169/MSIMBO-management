	<p>The IT industry is in high demand for talented coding programmers. On average 2% of the IT workforce are people of color. In the past few years, there have been a number of efforts by the IT industry to create programs and bootcamps to train young women of color, women and college students.</p>
	<p>MSIMBO seeks to address the displaced worker that cannot get training because of gender specific (i.e., Black Girls Code) training that being offered’ being financially unable to go or return to college and some of the coding bootcamps are cost prohibitive.</p>
	<p>MSIMBO bootcamp trains talented, low-income individuals to become full-stack web developers and launch a new career.
